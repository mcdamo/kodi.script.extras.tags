# script.extras.tags

This addon scans all your scraped videos for _Extras_ subfolders and tags them in your library.

## Introduction

_Extras_ are additional media files such as featurettes, behind-the-scenes, trailers, etc, that are associated with a particular Movie or TV Show.

Unlike _Specials_, _Extras_ are not scanned into the library so make sure your configuration [prevents Extras from being scraped](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:Extras#Preventing_Extras_Being_Added_To_Library).

The [Extras add-on](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:Extras) is a popular way for browsing this media in KODI.

## Before you begin

The extras folder name defaults to `Extras`. This folder should be in the top level any scraped Movie or TV Show path to be scanned.

The extras tag label defaults to `featurette`.

**This tag must be created and added to at least one Movie or TV Show before running this script.** Follow the [Video library tags instructions](https://kodi.wiki/view/Video_library_tags) to create the tag in your KODI library.
